       <p>Growing up I've always watched people in my family play games which lead to my own interest growing up.<br>My all time favorite game growing up was Spider-Man 3: The Movie Game, I vividly remember swinging throughout the city and protecting civilians.<br>Recently I dove into the game even managed to beat for the first time, something I could never do with my underdeveloped skills and short attention span.<br>I mostly play online games with my buddies, it can get very heated and competitive at times, but other than that it can fun.</p>
     <h3>Drawing</h3>

       <p>I was introduced to drawing in Upper Elementary by a close friend, beforehand I was a master at drawing stick figures and nothing more.<br>My friend showed me the basics of composition and I quickly got to drawing, but over time I slowed down and got sloppy with my art.<br>Recently, I'm relearning and trying to find my style as an artist.</p>
     <h3>Why I'm taking this class</h3>
       <p>The reason I'm taking this class is because I've always had an interest in coding when I introduced to it middle school.<br>Personally I have tried to deep dive into coding on my personal time but I've always would get demotivated so I decided to learn in a more educational environment. </p>
